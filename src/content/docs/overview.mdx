This site is a collection of notes based on my experience with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin development.
It is currently W.I.P. and there are many more pages to come. Suggestions for new topics or utilities are always welcome!

:::danger[Warning]
While I try to do my best to make sure that the information on this site is correct, there will certainly be mistakes.
Please open up an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fevol/obsidian-notes/issues) if you find any mistakes or have suggestions for improvements.
