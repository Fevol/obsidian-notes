import ObsidianIcons from '../../../components/ObsidianIcons.svelte';


This page lists all the icons that are available in Obsidian which can be used in your plugins or themes.
You can filter the icons by their identifier, by the version of Obsidian that they were introduced in, and whether they are a custom icon introduced by Obsidian or not.

:::caution[Warning]
Make sure that you check which icons are available in the versions of Obsidian that you are targeting.

If you are unsure, the default set-up will only show icons that are available between `1.4.16` and the current version of Obsidian.
To disable this behaviour, you can untoggle the `Filter by Obsidian version` checkbox below.

For more information on how to use these icons, check the [official Icons documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/User+interface/Icons).
