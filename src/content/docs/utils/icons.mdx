This page lists all the icons that are available in Obsidian to be used in your plugins or themes.
While most of these icons come directly from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons),
some icons are exclusive to Obsidian.
Depending on the version of Obsidian you are using, certain icons may not be available.

:::caution[Warning]
Make sure that you check which icons are available in the versions of Obsidian that you are targeting.
If you want to ensure support for older versions of Obsidian, set a _lower_ version in the dropdown below,
this will filter away all newer icons.
:::

For more information on how to use these icons, check the [official Icons documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/User+interface/Icons).
